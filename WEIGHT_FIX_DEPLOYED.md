# üéØ CRITICAL WEIGHT DATA FIX - READY TO DEPLOY

## What Was Wrong

**The Bug:** The app was calling the **WRONG Fitbit API endpoint** for weight data!

- ‚ùå **Wrong:** `/1/user/-/body/weight/date/{start}/{end}.json`
- ‚úÖ **Correct:** `/1/user/-/body/log/weight/date/{start}/{end}.json`

The missing `/log/` in the URL caused:
- The API to return a different JSON structure (`{"body-weight": [...]}` instead of `{"weight": [...]}`)
- The parsing logic to fail silently (looking for `weight` key that didn't exist)
- **Zero weight/body fat data to be cached**
- All cache logs showing `Weight: None lbs` and `Body Fat: None%`

## What Was Fixed

### Files Changed:
1. **`src/app.py`** (Lines 617 and 760)
   - Updated weight endpoint to include `/log/` in both Phase 1 fetch and retry logic
   - Endpoint now matches the test script that we verified works

### Commits:
- `bd3afcc` - CRITICAL FIX: Correct weight API endpoint to /body/log/weight/
- `f4c5875` - DIAGNOSTIC: Add weight cache diagnostic script
- `a64a1fe` - FEATURE: Enhanced weight and body fat headers

## How to Deploy

### On Your Homelab (Dockge):

1. **Pull the latest code:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/fitbit-web-ui-app-kb
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Rebuild the container:**
   In Dockge UI:
   - Stop the `fitbit-report-app-enhanced` stack
   - Click "Rebuild" or "Update"
   - Start the stack

   OR via command line:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

3. **IMPORTANT - Clear Old Cache (Optional but Recommended):**
   Since the old cache has no weight data, you might want to start fresh:
   ```bash
   # Backup old cache first (just in case)
   cp cache/fitbit_cache.db cache/fitbit_cache_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).db
   
   # Delete old cache to start fresh
   rm cache/fitbit_cache.db
   
   # Restart container - it will create new DB with correct schema
   docker-compose restart
   ```

4. **Verify It's Working:**
   - Check container logs: `docker logs fitbit-report-app-enhanced | grep -i weight`
   - You should see lines like:
     ```
     üì• 'Weight' missing 365 days. Fetching entire range...
     [CACHE_DEBUG] Caching Weight for 2025-10-20: Weight=182.5, Body Fat=20.5%
     ‚úÖ [CACHE_VERIFY] Weight/Fat cached successfully for 2025-10-20
     ```

5. **Wait for Background Cache Builder:**
   - The background builder runs hourly
   - It will fetch up to 365 days of weight data in the first cycle
   - Weight will show up in reports after ~1-2 hours

6. **Run Diagnostic Script (Optional):**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/fitbit-web-ui-app-kb
   python3 check_weight_cache.py
   ```
   This will show you exactly what's in the cache.

## What You'll See After Fix

### In Cache Logs:
```
üìä Daily Metrics:
  Steps: 11076
  Calories: 3162
  ...
  Weight: 182.8 lbs          ‚Üê NOW POPULATED!
  Body Fat: 20.5%            ‚Üê NOW POPULATED!
  SpO2: 93.9
```

### In Reports:
- **Weight Log Chart** with trend line and enhanced header:
  ```
  Weight
  
  ‚öñÔ∏è Most Recent: 182.8 lbs (10/28) | Earliest: 180.5 lbs (10/15) | Change: üìà +2.3 lbs
  Overall avg: 181.5 lbs | Last 30d avg: 182.1 lbs
  ```

- **Body Fat % Chart** with trend line and enhanced header:
  ```
  Body Fat %
  
  üí™ Most Recent: 20.5% (10/28) | Earliest: 20.0% (10/15) | Change: üìà +0.5%
  Overall avg: 20.7% | Last 30d avg: 20.8%
  ```

## Why This Fix Works

1. ‚úÖ **Correct API Endpoint:** Now calling `/body/log/weight/` which returns the structure we need
2. ‚úÖ **Correct Parsing Logic:** Code already expects `{"weight": [...]}` format
3. ‚úÖ **Database Schema:** `body_fat` column already exists in schema
4. ‚úÖ **Per-Metric Caching:** Background builder independently checks for missing weight data
5. ‚úÖ **Token Refresh:** Background builder refreshes tokens properly to avoid 401 errors

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to homelab
2. Monitor logs for successful weight data caching
3. Download a new cache log after 1-2 hours to verify
4. Generate a report and enjoy your weight/body fat charts! üéâ
