## üìä Metrics Overview

### Standard Metrics (Always Included)
**API Cost: ~15 calls per report** - Well within Fitbit's 150 requests/hour limit

- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Heart Rate & Resting Heart Rate** - Daily and historical trends
- üëü **Steps** - Daily step count with heatmap visualization
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Weight** - Body weight tracking (with kg ‚Üí lbs conversion)
- ü´Å **SpO2 (Blood Oxygen)** - Oxygen saturation levels
- üò¥ **Sleep Analysis** - Sleep stages, duration, and regularity
- üèÉ **Cardio Fitness Score (VO2 Max)** - Cardiovascular fitness
- ‚ö° **Active Zone Minutes** - Heart rate zone activity tracking
- üî• **Calories Burned** - Daily energy expenditure
- üìè **Distance Traveled** - Daily distance (with km ‚Üí miles conversion)
- üè¢ **Floors Climbed** - Elevation gain tracking
- üí™ **Exercise Log** - Detailed workout history with HR zones

### Advanced Metrics (Optional - Checkbox Required)
**API Cost: ~3 calls per day of data** (e.g., 79-day report = 237 additional calls ‚ö†Ô∏è)

- üíì **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)** - Stress and recovery indicator
- üå¨Ô∏è **Breathing Rate** - Respiratory rate during sleep
- üå°Ô∏è **Skin Temperature** - Temperature variation tracking

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Advanced metrics require one API call per day, which can quickly exhaust Fitbit's 150 requests/hour limit. Keep them **OFF** by default and only enable for shorter date ranges (‚â§30 days) when needed.

## Self-Hosting with Docker Compose (OAuth Enabled)

### Prerequisites

1. **Create a Fitbit Application** at [https://dev.fitbit.com/apps](https://dev.fitbit.com/apps)
   - Application Type: `Personal`
   - OAuth 2.0 Application Type: `Server`
   - Callback URL: Your server URL (e.g., `https://fitbitkb.yourdomain.com/` for production with HTTPS)
   - Note your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
   - **Note:** The app automatically requests all necessary permissions (Profile, Activity, Heart Rate, Sleep, Weight, SpO2, Breathing Rate, Temperature, Location)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fitbit-web-ui-app-kb.git
   cd fitbit-web-ui-app-kb
   ```

2. **Create environment file**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

3. **Edit `.env` file** with your Fitbit app credentials:
   ```bash
   CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   REDIRECT_URL=http://192.168.x.x:5032/
   DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
   API_KEY=your_secure_api_key_here
   ```
   > **Note**: Replace `192.168.x.x:5032` with your actual server IP and port
   > 
   > **Security**: 
   > - `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`: Protects the web dashboard (optional but recommended)
   > - `API_KEY`: Secures API endpoints for MCP/external access (optional - if not set, API is unprotected)

4. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. **Access the app** at `http://192.168.13.5:5032/` (or your configured URL)

6. **Login** - Click "Login to FitBit" button and authorize the app

### Docker Compose Configuration

```yaml
services:
  fitbit-ui:
    build: .
    container_name: fitbit-report-app
    ports:
      - "5032:80"
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - CLIENT_ID=${CLIENT_ID}

      - TZ=America/New_York  # Set your timezone (e.g., America/Chicago, America/Los_Angeles, Europe/London)
```

## Legacy Self-Hosting (Manual Token Entry)

If you prefer the original manual token entry method:

```yaml
services:
    fitbit-ui:
        image: 'thisisarpanghosh/fitbit-report-app:latest'
        container_name: 'fitbit-report-app'
        ports:
            - "5000:80"
        restart: unless-stopped
```

## üîß Recent Updates & Bug Fixes

### üéâ New Features (October 30, 2025)
**üìä CSV Export for Cache Data**
- Added CSV export button to Cache Log Viewer (`/cache-log`)
- Excel-compatible format with dynamic columns based on selected metrics
- Perfect for creating custom charts, long-term trend analysis, and data sharing
- Exports all metrics: Daily (Steps, Weight, HR, etc.), Sleep, HRV, Activities, and more

**üîá Reduced Log Verbosity**
- Disabled per-metric caching debug logs (CACHE_DEBUG and CACHE_VERIFY)
- Reduces log spam by ~90% while keeping critical error messages
- Makes troubleshooting easier by highlighting actual issues

### üêõ Weight & Body Fat Fix (October 30, 2025)
**Symptom**: Weight and Body Fat % showed as `None` in all reports and cache logs, despite having data in Fitbit app.

**Root Cause**: App was calling the wrong Fitbit API endpoint (`/body/weight/` instead of `/body/log/weight/`), causing the API to return a different JSON structure that the parsing logic couldn't handle.

**Fix**: Updated weight endpoint to `/body/log/weight/` in both Phase 1 fetch and retry logic. Also added enhanced headers showing most recent vs. earliest weight/body fat with change indicators.

**Impact**: Weight and Body Fat data now cache and display correctly with beautiful trend charts.

---

### üêõ Comprehensive Per-Metric Caching Fix (October 28, 2025)
**Symptom**: Even after previous fixes, some metrics remained fragmented. For example, Steps might be 100% cached but Calories only 80% cached, despite both being Phase 1 metrics.

**Root Cause**: Gemini identified that the fragmentation bug affected **ALL 12+ metrics**, not just the 4 Phase 3 metrics (Sleep, HRV, BR, Temp). If any Phase 1 metric (Steps, Calories, Distance, Floors, AZM, RHR, Weight, SpO2) failed during initial fetch, the builder would never retry it.

**The Fix - Three Parts:**

1. **`cache_manager.py` - Universal Per-Metric Checking**: Added individual SQL checks for ALL metrics (steps, calories, distance, floors, azm, heartrate, weight, spo2, cardio_fitness, activities, hrv, breathing_rate, temperature, sleep). Each uses `WHERE metric_column IS NOT NULL` to accurately detect missing dates.

2. **`app.py` - Phase 1 Retry Loop**: Added intelligent retry logic after Phase 1 completes. The builder now:
   - Checks EACH Phase 1 metric individually for missing dates
   - Re-fetches only the metrics that have gaps
   - Runs every hourly cycle until ALL metrics are 100% cached

3. **`app.py` - Phase 3 Per-Metric (Already Implemented)**: Each Phase 3 metric (Sleep, HRV, Breathing Rate, Temperature) is fetched independently with its own missing date check.

**Impact**: Eliminates ALL cache fragmentation. Every metric is now tracked and filled independently, ensuring eventual 100% cache completion for all metrics.

---

### üêõ NULL Overwrites Fix (October 28, 2025)
**Symptom**: Fragmented metrics - Oct 5-10 had some data, Oct 20-26 had different data, Active Zone Minutes stopped on Oct 19, exercise log empty.

**Root Cause**: Phase 1 cache builder iterated over ALL 365 days, but Fitbit API only returns dates with data. When a metric had no data for a date, the function skipped caching, but subsequent metric UPSERTs would overwrite previously cached values with NULL.

**Fix**: Modified `process_and_cache_daily_metrics()` to extract dates directly from API response instead of iterating over a fixed 365-day list. Now only caches dates that the API actually returned.

**Impact**: Eliminates fragmented data across date ranges.

---

### üêõ Heart Rate Zones Fix (October 27, 2025)
**Symptom**: Cache logs showed "‚úÖ Cached 366 days of heart rate data" but HR zones were empty in reports.

**Root Cause**: Phase 1 cache builder only cached Resting Heart Rate, not the Fat Burn/Cardio/Peak zone minutes.

**Fix**: Expanded `heartrate` handler to extract and cache all HR zone data (Fat Burn at index 1, Cardio at index 2, Peak at index 3).

**Impact**: HR zones now populate correctly from cache.

### Enhanced Edition Philosophy

This fork represents a **fundamental architectural shift** from the original project:

**Original Approach**: Manual token entry, on-demand API fetching, no persistence  
**Enhanced Approach**: OAuth 2.0 authentication, intelligent caching, background data population, MCP API integration

#### Key Enhancements:
- üîê **OAuth 2.0 & Automatic Token Refresh** - Seamless authentication without manual token management
- üíæ **SQLite Caching System** - Persistent data storage with 3-phase hourly background builder
- üöÄ **Real-Time Today Refresh** - Always fetch fresh data for today while serving history from cache
- üîå **MCP Server Integration** - RESTful API for LLM-powered insights via Model Context Protocol
- üîí **Dual-Port Security** - Separate OAuth callback and password-protected dashboard
- üìä **Advanced Analytics** - Exercise-sleep correlations, sleep timeline visualizations, drill-down features
- ‚è∞ **Smart Rate Limit Management** - 3-phase caching strategy respects Fitbit's 150 calls/hour limit
